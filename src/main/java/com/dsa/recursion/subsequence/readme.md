## All the problems here are based on the subsequences
___
### Problem Statements :
1. Print all the subsequences of an array. A subsequence is a
   contiguous/non-contiguous, which follows the order.
   For example :
   `[3,1,2] => [[3],[1],[2],[],[3,1],[3,2],[1,2],[3,1,2]]`
2. Print all the subsequences of the given string.
3. You're given an array *nums* of *n* integers. Return all the
   subset sums of the *nums* in *non-decreasing* order.
